      <h2>Summary Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I am a quick study with a diverse background of knowledge, and I love working on interesting problems. I have several years experience working as a computer programmer. I also worked for several years previously in scientific research. In both these careers, I honed my skills writing software, analyzing data, making inferences, and communicating findings.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Pipeline Generator (github.com/Gruss-MRRC/pipe-gen) 2015 - present</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Java application to help researchers at Gruss MRRC compose and run image processing pipelines</li>
        <li>Features a visual workspace where users add and connect data-processing modules to describe a workflow</li>
        <li>Users then load a set of files to run through the steps of the workflow and the program will auto-generate a Makefile to perform the analysis using the input filenames</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>MRI Data Storage System 2015 - 2017</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Software system for storing MRI datasets at Gruss MRRC ensuring a standardized directory structure</li>
        <li>Separates roles and concerns of different users into different Java GUI clients
Logs all storage transactions in an SQLite database using JDBC</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Brew-Engine (brew-engine.com/engines/the-brew-engine.php) 2011 - present</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Web application using Javascript, PHP, and MySQL database backend</li>
        <li>Allows input of ingredients for a batch of homebrewed beer</li>
        <li>Based on these ingredients predicts properties of the beer such as color, alcohol by volume, and IBUs</li>
      </ul>
